## WIDGET

MoonPay's SDK simplifies the process of integrating MoonPay's widget into a partner's platform. The SDK allows partners to customize the widget's appearance and functionality, while also providing a communication channel for streamlined integration. One of the key benefits of the SDK is the ability to receive real-time notifications about important flow lifecycle events. This allows partners to provide an integrated sell flow where the MoonPay widget instructs the partner's wallet app to perform the necessary sell deposit.


## Example

Given below are the integration steps to embed the widget in your website : 

1. Add the MoonPay SDK as a script to your HTML file:

```HTML
<script src="https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/onmeta-sdk.js"></script>
```

2. Then, initialize the widget in your application:

```HTML
<script >
    let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
        // (It should be an id of an element not a class) which is set in step 2 above
        elementId: "widget", // Mandatory
        apiKey: "{api_key}", // Mandatory
        walletAddress: "0xEcc24eab0fb83Ef0c536b35C44C578F750FDBB6E", // Optional
        fiatAmount: 100, // Optional (If passed then minimum amount is 100 inr)
        userEmail: "test@test.com", // Optional (if passed user don't have to register in meta platform)
        chainId: "80001", // Optional (it should be passed along with the tokenAddress to show a particular token to the user)
        tokenAddress: "0xEcc24eab0fb83Ef0c536b35C44C578F750FDBB6E", // Optional
        metaData: {"userID" : "ABCDXXX", "userName" : "user"} // Optional
        successRedirectUrl : "https://www.sample.net", // Optional
        failureRedirectUrl : "https://www.sample.net", // Optional
    });
createWidget.init(); // it will initialize the widget inside the particular div element
createWidget.on(eventType, callbackFn); // this method will listen to the events of the widget
</script>
```

#### On successful embedding, you see below widget integrated in your website :
