# dApp SDK

Welcome to the dApp SDK, your one-stop solution for creating decentralized applications
 (dApps) with ease. The SDK provides a set of powerful, modular components that cover 
essential aspects of dApp development, such as payments, messaging, identity, governance, 
ads, and recommendations. Inspired by the Apple and Google development kits used for mobile 
app development, our dApp SDK aims to streamline the process of building, testing, and 
deploying dApps on various blockchain platforms.

This SDK can be used to build dApps and publish / distribute them on the dApp Stores
powered by dApp Store Kit.

## Features

The dApp SDK offers the following key components:

1. **Identity:** A comprehensive identity management module that provides user 
authentication, authorization, and user profile management in a decentralized manner.

2. **Messaging:** An encrypted messaging system enabling peer-to-peer communication between 
users, as well as group chats and broadcasting functionality.

3. **Payments:** A robust and secure payment module for handling cryptocurrency 
transactions, including support for multiple tokens and seamless integration with popular 
wallet providers. Supports Recurring, Seat Based or One Time payment. Integrated with the
dApp Store Fee module.


4. **Governance:** A flexible governance framework for implementing voting, proposals, and 
decision-making processes within your dApp, fostering community involvement and 
decentralized control.


5. **Zero Knowledge (ZK) Ads:** An advertising module for promoting products, services, and content within your 
dApp, featuring a transparent, user-controlled ad system that respects user privacy.

6. **Recommendations:** A machine learning-powered recommendation engine that generates 
personalized content suggestions for users based on their preferences and behavior within 
the dApp.


7. **Compute:** The Compute module offers a powerful, decentralized computing platform that 
allows developers to run complex tasks such as machine learning, data analytics, and other 
resource-intensive processes. Leveraging a network of decentralized providers, the Compute 
module provides a cost-effective and resilient solution for your dApp's computing needs.


8. **Storage:** The Storage module offers a decentralized storage solution for your dApp, 
allowing you to store, retrieve, and manage large and small files across a distributed 
network of storage providers. This module also includes CDN support for efficient content 
delivery to users worldwide.

9. **Device:** The device module offers access to device details.
